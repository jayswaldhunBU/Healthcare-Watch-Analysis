Section 1: Project Focus

The crux of our project is to see the effects, both physically and mentally, of remote work over a long period of time (6 months). This project has long term benefits because remote work is here to stay in various different forms. Certain teams have already gone fully remote while many have gone fully hybrid. Hence, by analyzing the effects of working remotely we can better be prepared for the future and the potential health consequences we will face. 
To start, there are four guiding hypotheses. One of these hypotheses is that “ Participants who have an average of 3 locations per week will have higher stress algorithms than people who use an average of 4 or more locations per week”. Our goals will be to either prove or disprove that using our analysis. Once we have provided our insights on the four hypotheses, we will move on to find correlations between factors that have not already been looked at. This way, we will help our client to see correlations between factors they might not have considered. 
Finally, if we are able to get this far, we will conduct a factor analysis and see how the factors influence each other. 

Section 2: Data

The type of data that we will be working with are Garmin data and surveys. Garmin is wearable technology (similar to an apple watch) which allows users to track key metrics that are important for the study. The key metrics that the watch is able to capture are: 

1. Heart rate
2. Inter-beat-interval
3. Stress (algorithm from FirstBeat)
4. Pulse 
5. Steps
6. Calories
7. Body Composition


The data involves 70 people and along with constantly monitoring the above metrics, the watch will randomly ping 3 times a day to complete a quick survey. The information shared during this process will be their current location, musculoskeletal discomfort and number of breaks etc. Finally, on Fridays, participants completed further participants completed the E-Work and the Flourishing scale surveys. Up until now, 3 months of data has been collected and we will be conducting data analysis on this as a benchmark for when the six months data is released (when the study concludes). 

Section 3: Limitations

Currently, the biggest limitation in the study is the attrition rate. Many members in the study have stopped filling out the surveys and also stopped providing information on their daily pings. Hence, it will be very difficult to conduct comparison tests due to the fact that there will be limited data in the six month collection phase. 


Section 4: Importance	

As to our knowledge, there is no study that uses wearable technology to track members working from home on their status for a six month period. As a result, this study will be crucial for the future because the prevalence of working from home is increasing. Teams in companies are apprehensive about going back in-person and many are already fully remote. Hence, it is essential to know the health effects because it is valuable for both the company and the individual. The company is able to make more educated decisions and the individuals will be able to make more informed decisions on their health. 


Section 5: Next Steps

Submit Availability Form for the PM
Take a deep look into the data and understand all of the variables
Schedule meeting to meet members of the team in-person on October 26, 2022. 
Look at each hypothesis for 3 month data and provide insights with data as evidence
Once 6 month data becomes available, provide comparative analysis on the changes between 3 and 6 month data.
